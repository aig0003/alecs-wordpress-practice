# What is this? #
This is a quick project used to experiment and learn skills with WordPress. It 
is meant to be an ongoing project I can use as a playground to learn new 
skills and familiarize myself with WordPress and PHP overall.

Since it seems to be a milestone for developers to create their own blog at one
point or another, I thought this would be the perfect theme to follow this 
project.

## What does it do? ##
Currently the project runs locally on my own device using [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/)

I intend to eventually deploy the site online, but as I am experimenting and
and familiarizing myselve with things, I felt seeing the files physically on my
device would be a good way of learning the file structure.

At the moment the project is very basic, using a modified version of the [Twenty Twenty-Two](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/)
theme, and features a very basic plugin for removing the admin bar from the
front end when viewing the site as an admin, as well as code for future plugins
as I incorporate what I am learning from [tutorials online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l7JTie_6jM&list=PLriKzYyLb28kR_CPMz8uierDWC2y3znI2)
